# header-merger
Merges multiple header files into a single one

## Purpose
This program is used for merging multiple header files into a single-file library. It is used for merging the libraries developed in other repositories (ie [`Simple-Image-Library`](https://github.com/mrc-tech/Bitmap) and [`AutoMat`](https://github.com/mrc-tech/AutoMat)) into a single file. This is particulary useful for portability.
