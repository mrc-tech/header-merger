# header-merger
Merges multiple header files into a single one

## Purpose
This program is used for merges multiple header files into a single-file library. It is used for merge the libraries developed in other repositories (ie `Simple-Image-Library` and `AutoMat`) into a single file. This is particulary useful for portability.
